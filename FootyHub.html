        <h2>Open war between Barça and Sevilla: Ansu Fati, the key to a radical decision</h2>
        <p>Sevilla will have to forget about signing Ansu Fati. Although the '10' has no place in FC Barcelona's plans, the Blaugrana board does not want to know anything about the Seville club.</p>
    </section>

        <p>Sevilla's interest in Ansu Fati has once again sparked the 'war' between the Seville club and FC Barcelona. Although the Andalusians could solve a headache for Barça with the '10', the Blaugrana board firmly maintains its stance of breaking all relations with a club that has disrespected the culé institution. The conflict between both clubs began last season when Sevilla stood up against Barça over the 'Negreira case'.

            After initiating investigations into the scandal involving the former vice president of the Technical Committee of Referees, the Seville board refused to send delegates to Montjuïc during the match played at the end of September 2023 (culé victory by 1-0). Since then, relations have deteriorated significantly and, after Sevilla's pressure on LaLiga (along with Atlético and Athletic) to prevent the registration of Dani Olmo, Barça has decided, once and for all, to veto the Andalusians from any market operation.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Barça is clear: Ansu must leave, but not to Sevilla</h3>
    <p>This includes, of course, the possible loan or transfer of Ansu, one of the players that Francisco García Pimienta had on his agenda for the winter market. The performance of the culé '10' in the last Barça-Sevilla (he played 74 minutes in the 5-1 rout) convinced the Spanish coach to go for the 22-year-old forward, although his recent physical problems have significantly cooled the rumors about the operation.</p>
    <p>With Fati back in action (he played 28 minutes on Saturday in Barbastro), the Seville club attempted to resume contact with Barça, but received a cold shoulder from the Blaugrana team. Barça prioritizes the loan of the winger, but to any other club other than Sevilla. Jorge Mendes, the player's agent, made it clear that the decision about his client's future is in the hands of the club. 

        "In the world of football, everything changes in five minutes. We have to wait and see. He has shown that he had the courage to play at Barça and that he has an impressive level", commented the Portuguese agent in an interview with 'Mundo Deportivo'. Outside of LaLiga, Ansu has been mentioned as a possible reinforcement for Aston Villa and Tottenham, but for now, there is no formal offer for the '10'.

        <h2>Chiesa set to stay at Liverpool</h2>
        <img src="Federico Chiesa.webp" width="500" height="300">
        <p>Federico Chiesa looks set to continue at Liverpool despite links over a return to Serie A with Napoli.

            The 27-year-old has made just four appearances for Liverpool across all competitions so far this season, starting just once and not featuring in the Premier League - where the dominant Reds sit top with a six-point cushion - since September.
            
            Such a frustrating spell has led to rumours that Chiesa’s Liverpool career could be over before it’s really begun, with reports that the club agreed to allow him to leave on loan in January following a meeting with agent Fali Ramadani.
            
            Napoli are rumoured to have made contact over a potential deal and it has been claimed they will submit a six-month loan offer for Chiesa this week.
            
            However, Ramadani has now dismissed such speculation and claimed that his client will remain at Liverpool beyond the end of the January window.
            
            “Napoli did not negotiate a contract with Chiesa from Liverpool in the winter period, and the club has no intention of dispensing with the player,” he told 365Scores.
            
            “The player is continuing with Liverpool and is seeking the opportunity to participate in the coming period. This is what I can confirm now.”</p>

        <h2> Tottenham extend Son Heung-Min's contract by further year</h2>
        
        <img src="Son Heung Min.jpg" height="400" width="500">
<p> Tottenham Hotspur have taken up their option to extend Son Heung-Min's contract by a further year to 2026, the club confirmed on Tuesday.
    The 32-year-old's existing agreement was due to expire at the end of the season but Spurs were always relaxed about the situation given they could exercise a clause inserted into the deal he signed in 2021.
    Son has made 431 appearances for Tottenham and was named club captain by Ange Postecoglou shortly after he became head coach in August 2023.
    Tottenham's decision puts an end to any speculation over Son's immediate future, but sources have told ESPN that the South Korea international was hopeful of a fresh, longer-term agreement.

<h2>James Rodriguez terminates contract at Rayo Vallecano, available for free in January transfer window</h2>
<img src="James-Rodriguez.png" height="400" width="500">
    <p>James Rodriguez, the top scorer at the FIFA World Cup 2014 and the runner-up at Copa America 2024, became a free agent after terminating his contract at La Liga side Rayo Vallecano, according to multiple reports in Spain.
    Rodriguez, 33, turned heads at the FIFA World Cup in Brazil when he scored from a jaw-dropping volley against Uruguay. With six goals, he won the Golden Boot and moved to Real Madrid that summer.
    He played 125 times for Los Blancos, winning nine major trophies with them, including two UEFA Champions League titles, two European Super Cups and as many La Liga titles.
    He then moved to Bayern Munich winning two Bundesliga titles but his club career plummeted since as he moved several clubs, including Everton in the Premier League to Al Rayyan in Qatar.
    At an international level, Rodriguez had a dream spell in the Copa America, scoring once and assisting six more - a tournament record -- as his side reached the final after 23 years.

He was also named in the Team of the Tournament and he then moved to Vallecano in August this year. However, his dismal club career could not have a turnaround as he reportedly left the club after just over fourth months.

<h2>Marcus Rashford Linked With Loan Move To AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund And Galatasaray In January Transfer Window</h2>
<img src="Marcus Rashford.jpg" height="500" width="700">
<h4>In addition to Bundesliga giants Dortmund and Serie A heavyweights Milan, Super Lig powerhouse Galatasaray are also interested in roping in the out-of-favour Manchester United forward.</h4>
<p>English forward Marcus Rashford may very well move to a new club on a loan switch in the ongoing January transfer window. The Sun recently claimed Rashford’s agent has travelled to Italy to meet the recruitment staff at AC Milan.

    The Sun article reported Rashford’s brother Dwaine was involved in exploratory talks with AC Milan about sending the Manchester United footballer on loan.
    But AC Milan is probably not the only outfit willing to acquire the services of Rashford. Transfer market specialist Fabrizio Romano recently claimed that Borussia Dortmund had “asked for conditions" of the deal to land Rashford. Romano also stated that Turkish side Galatasaray had also “approached" the English international.

    “Movements around Marcus Rashford have started as expected. Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan have both asked for conditions of the deal. More contactsare planned. Meanwhile, Galatasaray also approached Rashford this weekbuthe’sprioritising other options in the top 5 leagues now,"read the post shared by Fabrizio Romano on X (formerly Twitter).
    Another article by the Mirror claimed that Manchester United will allow Rashford to leave on loan. The possibility of the deal taking place depends on certain conditions, as per Mirror.

    According to Daily Mail, Manchester United would be willing to sell Rashford for an amount of £40 million but that figure, along with his wages of more than £325,000-a-week, may be a hindrance to the potential transfer. Daily Mail also stated that Rashford has already rejected offers from Saudi Arabia and wishes to stay in Europe.
    
    Rashford was a part of the Manchester United squad for last week’s home loss to Newcastle United but he did not featurein the game. He was not a part of the squad for his side’s Premier League contest against Liverpool. In December, last year, Rashford talked about being ready for a“new challenge."
    “I think I’m ready for a new challenge and the next steps. When I leave it’s going to be ‘no hard feelings’. If I know that a situation is already bad I’m not going to make it worse," Rashford told journalist Henry Winter, as per Sky Sports.

    Meanwhile, Manchester United currently are at the 13th spot in the Premier League standings. Having played 20 matches so far in the competition, they have collected 23 points. In their next match, Manchester United will be up against Arsenal in the FA Cup on Sunday, January 12.</p>

<h2>Chelsea transfer confirmed as young star Kai Crampton joins Bournemouth</h2>
<img src="Kai Crampton.jpg">
    <p>Chelsea have sold highly rated goalkeeper Kai Crampton to Bournemouth.

        The teenager turns 18 years old this month and says he is looking for a "good start" to his career after rising through the youth ranks at the Blues.
        
        Crampton, who was highlighted by Standard Sport last year as one of the best academy stars in London, is highly thought of and has played for England as Under-15, -16 and -17 level.
        He has already played senior football, for Isthmian League side Concord Rangers, during a short-term loan last season and was part of the Blues side who won the Under-17 Premier League Cup Final. This term Crampton represented National League South side Hampton & Richmond.
        “I’m over the moon to sign for AFC Bournemouth,” he told the official Cherries website. “I feel like it will be a good start to my journey through my career. It will be a good opportunity to get a lot of game time and you can see there is a good pathway at this club as young players are breaking into the first team.
        “I was at Chelsea for 11 years and had a good education there. I can bring my game knowledge of football to Bournemouth when I play. I just want to get as much game time as I can and do as well as I can to show the coaches and managers that I’m worth keeping.”

Crampton will at Bournemouth be reunited with goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, who is on loan from Chelsea and trained with the Blues youth teams for a spell.

It is the second transfer of the window for Chelsea, who last week recalled Aaron Anselmino from his loan spell at Boca Juniors.

        <h2>Lamine Yamal Confirms Long-Term Commitment to Blaugrana, Says ‘Barcelona Is the Club of My Life’</h2>
        <img src="Lamine Yamal.jpeg">
        <h4>Lamine Yamal confirmed that he plans on extending his current contract with FC Barcelona that runs till 2026. Yamal made his debut at the age of 15, earning him the title of the youngest player to ever play for the club.</h4>
        <p>  Lamine Yamal, a name that has risen to prominence over the course of the past year, has confirmed that he plans on extending his current contract with FC Barcelona that runs till 2026. The Spaniard, who played a crucial role in his country’s 2024 European Championship-winning campaign, has stated that FC Barcelona is the ‘club of his life’. 
            “I don’t know when (the contract will be signed), but I believe it’ll be soon. In the end, Barca is the club of my life. I hope to renew my contract with them and to be with them as long as possible. I want to play in the Spanish league. I want to play for Barca, and yes, I will renew my contract. I will,” Yamal told CNN.
            Yamal made his debut at the age of 15, earning him the title of the youngest player to ever play for the club, and has grown up watching the golden generation of the Catalonian side. Despite many labelling him to be the next Lionel Messi, Yamal surprisingly revealed that it was, in fact, Neymar Jr who he idolised while growing up.
            The 17-year-old was ruled out for up to four weeks with an ankle injury in December, which has proved to be a difficult period for his team. After tying the club’s best-ever start to the league under head coach Hansi Flick with seven wins in their opening seven games, the side has now fallen below Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the points table after having lost consecutive games against Leganes and Atletico.
            Yamal remains adamant that his side will continue to strive for the title. “In the end, La Liga will be won against the teams we’ve previously lost to. I think it’s about focus. We’ve shown in the important moments that we are the best and we’ll continue to do so,” said Yamal.

 <h2>Paulo Dybala's agent to meet with Roma in coming days ahead of contract renewal</h2>
<img src="Paulo Dybala.jpg" height="400" width="800">
 <p>Paulo Dybala’s future will likely continue to unravel in the Italian capital.

    After a difficult period of subpar performances and transfer rumors linking him with an exit, the Argentine is now closer than ever to extending his contract with the Giallorossi.
    As reported by La Gazzetta dello Sport, Dybala appears to be in a good place mentally and physically, to the point that his renewal (which will trigger automatically in the next weeks) is no longer deemed a problem for the capital club’s balance sheet.

The newspaper adds that Dybala’s agent, Carlos Novel, will meet with Roma sporting director Florent Ghisolfi in the coming days.

The two sides have spent the last weeks discussing the details of Dybala’s new deal and the time has come to put pen to paper.
